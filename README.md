# VelocityPoints

The backend and the frontend are seperated into their own directories.
Feel free to make changes as you see fit.
Before you test things out, I suggest you make your changes in your own branch (create a new branch using your terminal and continue your development until you're reeady to push it into the main branch) -> I believe this will prevent unexpected errors for everyone.
